Smart Motion Detection System
A modular IoT system designed for a university course project, built on a Raspberry Pi 3B+. The system uses multiple motion sensors to detect movement, logs the data, sends notifications, and integrates with third-party platforms like Adafruit IO and SOME/IP.

Features
Motion Detection: Tracks motion using five PIR sensors connected to the Raspberry Pi's GPIO pins.
Logging: Logs motion events to a local file for analysis and debugging.
Notifications: Sends email alerts when motion is detected.
Adafruit Integration: Pushes motion data to Adafruit IO for visualization and remote monitoring.
SOME/IP Integration: Sends motion events using the SOME/IP protocol for integration with automotive systems.
Modular Architecture: Each feature is implemented in a separate module for easy scalability and maintenance.

Hardware:

Raspberry Pi 3B+
5 PIR motion sensors (connected via GPIO pins)
Internet connection for Adafruit and email integration
Software:

Python 3.7+
Required Python libraries (see requirements.txt)

Setup
1. Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/ohkandil/smart_motion_detection.git
cd smart_motion_detection
2. Install Dependencies
Itâ€™s recommended to use a virtual environment:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Linux/Mac
venv\Scripts\activate     # On Windows

pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Configure Modules
Adafruit IO: Set your API key in adafruit_integration.py.
Email Notifications: Update email credentials in email_notifier.py.
4. Connect Hardware
Connect PIR sensors to GPIO pins on the Raspberry Pi. Ensure the pin numbers in motion_sensors.py match your setup.
Usage
1. Run the System
Start the main script to launch all components:

python main.py
2. Test Individual Components
To test specific modules, run their corresponding test scripts. For example:

python test_motion_sensors.py
python test_logger.py
How It Works
Motion Detection:
Each PIR sensor detects motion and sends a signal.
Inter-Process Communication (IPC):
Modules communicate using ZeroMQ to publish/subscribe to events.
Integrations:
Motion events are logged, pushed to Adafruit IO, sent via SOME/IP, and email alerts are triggered.
